Upstream blocked bugs:
- Emplacements spawn TOWS instead of MG's
- Setting capture point owner doesn't work

Playtest notes:
- Hide intro on death
- Replace 'Wave 1' with 'Next wave in' if all bots dead
- Also hide wave desc in that case?
- Remove bus ladder
- Make waves 1:30, or have a dynamic wave trigger with 30 second pauses
- Enemies left counter
- Make widgets invisible by default to avoid flashing
